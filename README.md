# Dijkstra-DFS-py

Hello everyone 

This little project's main target is to practice python generally, and OOP particulaly, and implementing two different graph algorithms:

DFS (iterative & recursive),
Dial's algorithm (optimized Dijkstra's algorithm version).

This program is able to receive any directed graph you wish (from size 2-26)
and execute one of the mentioned algorithms above.
